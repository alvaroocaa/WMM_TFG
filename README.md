# WMM code

WWM (World Magnetic Model) code for statistical analysis for TFG **Assessing the use of True North for aeronautical navigation**

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the use of True North in aeronautical navigation using the World Magnetic Model (WMM) for magnetic field calculations.

## Code organization

### Functions

This folder contains all the functions that are called in the **Main.py**

- **Database.py:** Handles SQLite database operations, cleans data, and exports it to an Excel spreadsheet for further processing and visualization.
  
- **File_creation.py:** Generates the input file required for the WMM software, containing date, elevation, and coordinates of each airport.
  
- **wmm_file_creation.py:** Executes the WMM software, feeding it with the prepared input file.
  
- **output_analysis.py:** Merges airport data with WMM software results into a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet for detailed analysis, adding magnetic area information based on airport coordinates.
  
- **Computations.py:** Contains functions for plotting figures which are saved in the Results folder.

### Necessary files

This folder contains essential files required for the code execution, including databases, output files, input files, and spreadsheets.

### Results

This folder contains all plots generated by the code, saved as .png files.

### WMM2020_Windows

This folder contains the WMM software version valid from 2020 to 2025, necessary for magnetic field calculations.
